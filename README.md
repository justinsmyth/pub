# pub

The code in the class "Pub" violates a lot of clean code principles.  Refactor the code using TDD and Clean Code principles so that it
is more extensible and easy to use.

The requirements of a Pub are:

1) Can process a drink order from a customer and return a price
2) Certain types of customers get a discount.  Students for example get a 10% discount.
3) Can query the pub for drinks available by ingredient
4) Drinks have a fixed price, they are not dependent on ingredients

Bonus points:

1) Pub can calculate alcholol content for a list of drinks
2) Get the occupancy of the pub and the percentage full of customers
